rightClick deactivates the context menu on websized pictures and more.
Picture page, akBookStyle, Lightbox, HD Shadowbox and photoWidget are protected by default.
Other valid jQuery selectors could be added to the default list.
By default, webmaster and administors keep the right-click available.

Context menus are disable on main browsers. 
Please, remind that rightClick is not a full secured solution against image copy.
